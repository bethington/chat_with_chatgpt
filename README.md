# Automated Chat with ChatGPT using Selenium

This repository contains code that automates chat interactions with ChatGPT using Selenium and ChromeDriver. ChatGPT is a large language model that can engage in conversations and provide responses to user inputs. With this code, you can have automated and interactive chats with ChatGPT right from your Python environment.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a seamless and programmatic way to interact with ChatGPT. Using Selenium and ChromeDriver, the code enables you to send messages and receive responses from ChatGPT, allowing for easy integration of ChatGPT into your own applications or projects.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install Selenium using the following command:
   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver for your system and place it in the project directory. Ensure that the ChromeDriver version matches your installed Chrome browser version.

## Usage

1. Open the project directory on your local machine.

2. Update the `chromedriver_path` variable in the code with the path to your ChromeDriver executable.

3. Run the script `automated_chat.py`.

4. The code will open a web browser window, interact with ChatGPT on a chat interface, and print the conversation to the console.

5. You can modify the conversation in the script to simulate different interactions with ChatGPT.

## Contributing

Contributions and improvements to the code are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
